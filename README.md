# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository on GitHub! This repository is a collection of various data science projects that I have worked on. Each project is designed to showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Feel free to explore and learn from the different projects included here.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, navigate to the respective project directory by clicking on the links in the table of contents. Each project directory contains a detailed README file with information about the project, including:

- **Description**: An overview of the project's goals and objectives.
- **Data**: Details about the datasets used, including sources and preprocessing steps.
- **Notebooks**: Links to Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for the analysis and modeling.
- **Results**: Summarized findings, insights, and visualizations from the project.
- **Dependencies**: A list of required libraries and dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code for any project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks (optional but recommended)
- Required libraries (specified in the project README)

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
